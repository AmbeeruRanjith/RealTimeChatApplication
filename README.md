Prerequisites
Node.js (v16 or above recommended)

npm (comes with Node.js)

Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
bash
git clone <your-repo-url> chat-app
cd chat-app
2. Setup and Start the Backend
bash
cd backend
npm install
Create a .env file in the backend directory with the following content:

text
PORT=5000
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
Start the backend server:

bash
npm start
3. Setup and Start the Frontend
Open a new terminal window/tab:

bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
The React app will open at http://localhost:3000.

Usage
Open http://localhost:3000 in multiple browser windows or devices.

Type your message and click Send or press Enter.

Messages will appear in real-time across all connected clients.

Troubleshooting
Module not found errors: Ensure you have run npm install in both backend and frontend directories.

Port conflicts: Make sure ports 3000 (frontend) and 5000 (backend) are free.

CORS issues: Ensure CLIENT_URL in .env matches your frontend URL.

Customization
Usernames: The current setup assigns a random username. You can enhance this by adding a login or username prompt.

Message Persistence: To persist messages across server restarts, integrate a database (e.g., MongoDB).

Styling: Modify frontend/src/styles/App.css for custom themes.
